PGM WILL HAVE TO DO THE FOLLOWING


1)In the PFF algorithm, we decide if a new frame should be allocated based on the time since the last page fault.  For this, you can use a number of page accesses (remember those integers in the file)
You must decide what a reasonable F value is.Try a few different values.  Record the total number of page faults across the run of the program.  Put a short comment in your code about how F impacts the total number of page faults.


2)In the VSWS algorithm, we have M,L and Q to help us decide when to run the algorithm.  Determine some reasonable numbers for these values and put a comment in your code to indicate how changes impact the total number of page faults.
